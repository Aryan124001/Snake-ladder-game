# Snake Ladder Game

This is a C++ implementation of the classic Snakes and Ladders game. The program calculates the **minimum number of moves** required to win the game using a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm. The board is fully customizable with any number of snakes and ladders.

## Features

* **Dynamic Board Size:** Play on an n Ã— n board.
* **Customizable Snakes and Ladders:** Input your own snake and ladder positions.
* **Optimal Moves Calculation:** Uses BFS to determine the minimum number of moves to win.
* **Easy to Compile and Run:** Simple command-line interface for interaction.

## Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) supporting **C++11** or later.
